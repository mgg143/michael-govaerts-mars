    <h2>About</h2>
        <img src="images/BlrMGGDgs2025.jpg" alt="A softly-focused picture of Michael, laughing with his eyes closed and facing the camera, sitting on a bench in a wooded area in late afternoon daylight, fending off two friendly, large black dogs (his &quot;siblings&quot;) showing great interest in him who are between him and the camera in the foreground" class="profile-image">
        <p>I possess a wealth of professional experience in healthcare, real estate, law, and education, primarily through work as a project manager. Throughout these experiences, I consistently observed how stakeholders interacted with technology and how effectively it served their needs. Driven by a desire to help address the need for more skilled technical professionals to enhance human-computer interactions in ways that benefit all, especially the least fortunate, I have pursued additional training in the field and look forward to contributing as a capable software engineer.</p>
